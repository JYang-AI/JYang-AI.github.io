I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu).\
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [UC Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) and a visiting researcher at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu), working with [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com) and [Prof. Shaolei Ren](https://shaoleiren.github.io). 
Prior of that, I received PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California, Riverside, advised by [Prof. Shaolei Ren](https://shaoleiren.github.io). I graduated from [BUPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications) with M.S. and [Xidian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University) with B.E. 

My research goal is to advance **responsible and efficient AI and computing**. Currently, I am focusing on addressing the social concerns of AI, particularly in terms of sustainability, privacy, fairness, and safety issues. In general, my research interests lie in the following areas.
