## Join Our Team: Multiple PhD Openings in Computer Science at the University of Houston

Dr. Jianyi Yang (https://jyang-ai.github.io/), incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Houston, is seeking PhD students in Computer Science starting in Spring 2025 or Fall 2025. Full financial support will be provided.

**Bio of  PI** Dr. Jianyi Yang will join the Department of Computer Science at the University of Houston as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. He will be jointly appointed at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of UH. Currently, He is a postdoctoral researcher at UC Riverside, and concurrently a visitor at Caltech. His research goal is to advance responsible and efficient AI and computing. Recently, he is focusing on addressing the social concerns of AI, particularly in terms of sustainability, privacy, fairness, and safety issues. His research has been published in top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI) and top CS conferences (ACM SIGMETRICS, IEEE INFOCOM, ACM e-Energy). 

**Research Directions** 
Dr. Yang’s research topics span both fundamental methods and real-world problems. He will bring a wealth of expertise and mentorship to his students in the following directions.
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (trustworthy ML, learning-augmented  algorithms, efficient large AI models, etc.)
Decision Intelligence and Optimization (reinforcement learning, online optimization/control, online allocation algorithms, etc.)
Cyber Physical Systems and Critical Infrastructures (resource management in data centers, energy systems and smart city applications, etc.)
Cloud/Edge Computing and Networks (energy harvesting systems, edge AI, distributed computing, etc.)

**Qualifications**
The candidates are required to hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related areas. Importantly, candidates should have a strong motivation and interest in AI research and have the passion for high-quality research works. No prior experience is required but priority will be given to the candidates with one or two of the following aspects: solid foundation in mathematics (optimization, statistics, ML basics), proficiency in implementing research ideas, related AI research project experiences.
