Prior of that, I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of California, Riverside, advised by <a href="https://shaoleiren.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Shaolei Ren</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BUPT</a> with M.S. and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xidian University</a> with B.E.</p> <p>My research lies in machine learning algorithms and their applications in sustainable AI systems. On the one hand, my research focus on pricipled <strong>learning-augmented algorithms</strong>, utilizing domain knowledge (e.g. existing policy/algorithms, system models, optimization theory) to provide performance guarantees for real AI deployments. On the other hand, my research designs learning-based methods to address the online resource allocation and decision-making problems in achieving <strong>sustainable AI</strong>.</p> </body></html>
