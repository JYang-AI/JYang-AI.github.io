Learning-augmented algorithms utilize ML advice or
data-driven methods in algorithm design to improve the empirical performance with theoretical guarantee. In many mission-critical systems such as data centers, energy systems, edge/cloud computing,
and transportation systems, classic expert
algorithms or policies have worst-case performance
guarantee or have been programmed in the real world for a
long time, so they can be trusted in terms of some critical
performance metrics. However, they may not achieve a satisfactory empirical performance on average. 
Therefore, we design learning-augmented algorithms for various problems to improve the average reward while guaranteeing the critical metrics.
